Welcome to Vraag's documentation!
=================================

Vraag is a library for working with the Blender Python API, inspired by JQuery, and hence the name. "Vraag" is Dutch for question/query.

Over time, the "Vraag Construct" part of the library has taken up most of the interest in Vraag, and it now provides a rich and expressive way to create geometry and scenes
in Blender. Construct in turn was inspired by OpenScad, but uses Blender for all the
CSG, and also leaves behind native Blender objects and modifiers.
